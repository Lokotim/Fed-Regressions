This project was developed as a term paper under the supervision of Dr. Rozmainsky.

The paper itself can be found in docs/TermPaper2025.docx, it splits the history of the fed from 1954 to 2017 into the three periods of the last three operating regimes and regresses macroeconomic and political variables on proxies for monetary policy and finds that each periods has different influences, and the post-2008 period has especially different influences. This is the first time that a paper examines the influences of the Fed by operating regime.

The quantitative analysis was made using R and can be found in src/ScriptTermPaper2025.r while the output is a table of the different regressions and can be found in docs/regression_table.docx

DISCLAIMER!
The final output can have tiny différences in correlation coefficients for the post-2008 models because the FRED data may have been revised between time of writing the paper and the present time.
